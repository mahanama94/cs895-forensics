Ahem...

 In this age of media reality the good minister might be banking on an entirely new source of value.

Within 12 months it is USD 4.5 billion. This all in US dollars. You cannot inflate that or print that.  That is not going to go away. That is the reality. Yes, you can do it.. You can see a sunshine even inside a deep mine..  @GotabayaR @PresRajapaksa @SecPompeo

Take action protect the confidence of investors.
Make sure this kind of silly mistakes will not happen in future I would like to Thank you taking an action . But it’s quite delay.. Hope this is not just words. 22% drop and nothing happened even with sec and cse cleared this credit saga. If you intervene quickly you can at least prevent big  disaster being happening at the moment. Any way a big damage already done. My idea it's too late you came to intervene but at least for the future it will help.I personally convinced more than 150 foreign workers to invest in Sri Lanka to get those hold foreign currency into our country. But 85% of my these investors got bad impression about our SEC,CSE and Brokers for purposely bringing the market down for personal agenda that is they collected their clients stocks @ low prices to their accounts."

Agreed with the statement but how believe that ASP drop 9000 to 6,854 within 7week. this is not good for healthy market. you should do something to stable this situation, not enough giving Twitter Msg. Motivate funds to buy ASAP and foreign buying as well. Thank you. Most of CSE investors have ran out of buying power. So now government Funds needs to stimulate the market by buying good shares and pushing ASP at least by 500 points. When the market goes up, investors will get additional buying power. That's how you can revive CSE again. Hope our brilliant CMM appreciates your excellent point."

We could not find some essentials like milk powder and sugar in the market.
And as an economist, you failed and we are starving.
Even with people with high bank balances cannot survive without food  And people including daily wage earners should be alive to look after their families.

None of them are working in a Covid ward.
None of them are struggling to get their ICU beds.

Privileged Sri Lankans making fun of people in queues at liquor stores yesterday. Most of those men are buying alcohol to resell, so that they can use the profits to feed their families. Lockdowns will hit the most vulnerable while the arm chair critics whine from cushy homes. Hospitals are full and running out of resources. What are your suggestions to slow down the spread and give the health syastem to stabilize? Will they live to pay loans if things go like this ? I was of the same opinion till 2 weeks back. Yet when people start dying helplessly at home without proper medical care/monitoring we cannot just turn a blind eye as a civilized society. Those politicos who instigated shouting protest rallies should be held accountable. You didnt think of that in March 2020 when we had a handful of cases you closed down for nearly 3 months now deaths are increasing and the health sector about to collapse you think of it? You should've invested in the health sector instead of building a tower which is of no use I do agree with you. Now we are at a point where closing the country would result financial ruin for the daily wage workers, low income individuals (and their families) as well as businesses.

If it's the 1% then the Country will receive a total inflow of USD 50 Billion ! Which is it ?  We are with you Yet you are suspected of aiding, abetting, and in certain scenarios masterminding, the mass corruption and pillaging of public coffers in this country.

He's making the best possible effort to put things right by radiating positive vibes.
You Reap what you Sow. Rather than pinpointing Moody, you better work effectively to mitigate current financial calamity. Now you have all powers, prove your self through results. Get the support from @HarshadeSilvaMP if he is willing to help to develop #srilanka  So pissed off at Moody’s . They think we can’t print more money to fix our situation . Tell them @an_cabraal printing money is the solution Lol this is becoming a joke now  Question ! Will They revise their stance seeing above  

We thought you are there to make corrective action, rather than twitting  Moody’s, by its own admission after the 2008 fin crash, stated that they only give “opinions” when asked why all the financial institutions, like the Lehman Brothers, had highest Moody’s ranking up until the morning of the crash. So, save to say, Moody’s proved their “integrity”. Hahahahah"

If many CITIZENS wants leave, capitalize e opportunity & send them to all prospective countries removing all HIGH CHARGES by agencies. 

Condition all to send $ remittances immediately Send all lazy government sector employees first! Not according to banks Some government university students leave the country right after graduating and not coming back. Bond should be there to make sure you serve your country at least for 10 years to payback the SL tax money or send certain amount of USD remittance back within a given period.. Agree ලබ්බට තියපු අත පුහුලටත් තියනවා  @an_cabraal What about remittance by Sri Lankan who is doing remote works? Is @CBSL  considering it as ""Service export""? Yes, that was the discussion. NO BANK WAS ASKING TO CONVERT NON RESIDENT WORKER REMITTANCES.  Legalise crypto currency withdrowel to Local bank accounts.. not deposits.. lots of people make/earn  income by trading n holding crypto cruncies  .. let them bring some usd to local banks. Increase the rate by LKR 50 minimum to see the inflow. When the whole world is changing embrace the change, people will not listen to you, you have to Listen to people. Migrant temittance are the key to our economy n they deserve better."

Per capita GDP is only an average. It doesn't account for wealth imbalance. For example the money our politicians have is way higher than people's money. A good table you published. With highest per capita GDP among the above, we are begging from countries with lesser per capita GDP. That shows how our politicians have cleansed our wealth and the inefficiency of the governments and so called CB governors including you. It’s simple - just trickle-up economics.

So what about the greek investments Mr. Erranous Cabraal? When are you going to get suspended for money printing, laundering, and other stuff? If the gov banks are capable of releasing required $ at a proper rate, demand for these places will go down rapidly.

As of now, it is close to impossible to get $ released for critical activities such as foreign travel or educational payments.

Fix the root cause not symptoms. That money changer is not the only thing that should be suspended... I urge you to suspend trading in the stock market. We can't log to trading due to the power cut. All are loss. Please attention this.  @CSE_Media Any Arrests ?  If the law works to him what people have to for the front runner of this #EconomicCrisisLK Gohome cabba Do we have a procedure to suspend you. Don’t you realize that your policies have failed.
