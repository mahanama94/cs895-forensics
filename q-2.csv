Ahem...

Within 12 months it is USD 4.5 billion. This all in US dollars. You cannot inflate that or print that.  That is not going to go away. That is the reality. Yes, you can do it.. You can see a sunshine even inside a deep mine..  @GotabayaR @PresRajapaksa @SecPompeo

Kitchawela evarai it is shame for other chartere accountants as well. No one will respect CAs now because of this person. Cabbo, Finance minister stating that they have trusted “Undial” methods for Government payments. I think you are in the same Governor position at that time. Not only that, the GOSL has violated the sanction against the North Korea. Amazing, after all we can’t let the factory in Biyagama go to waste. Let’s make good use of them money printers while we can. Thank you governor for clearing the air!
