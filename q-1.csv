Ahem...

 In this age of media reality the good minister might be banking on an entirely new source of value.

Within 12 months it is USD 4.5 billion. This all in US dollars. You cannot inflate that or print that.  That is not going to go away. That is the reality. Yes, you can do it..

Do you let it to float freely until the supply and demand saturated ? Rupee Devaluation will Encourage EXPORTS and Discourage IMPORTS and will make our Exports Affordable to others.
Due to Rupee Devaluation Cost of LIVING would go up But we can Sort Internal Matters within Ourselves by Announcing some Assistance to the Poorest.  වාව් නයිස් වර්ඩ්, නම්‍යශීලී  #කොන්දකෙලින් Pls print more money :) This will Definitely Encourage Exporters and Foreign Workers to send USD to the country. Slowly we should Take the USD to 250 very soon so it will Put a Complete Stop on to Black Market. Traditionally the Different Between official USD Rates is 1 or 2% I bet the black market moves to 285 or something like that @an_cabraal, I hope this will not be reversed by midnight tomorrow. Anyway, thanks for doing the right thing, at least now. Closing the stable door after the horse has bolted !",https://twitter.com/an_cabraal/status/1500882469112872960
